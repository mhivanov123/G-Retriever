{"sent":"Is there a role for the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) in lung cancer?","qc":["C0684249","C0242379","C1306460"],"exact_answer":"yes","ideal_answer":"To explore a correlation between CYLD expression and responsiveness to TRAIL in lung cancer cell lines, we established lung cancer cell lines that stably express CYLD. Our data provided the first evidence that increased expression of CYLD directly blocks TRAIL-induced NF - B activation, and consequently increases TRAIL-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. CYLD may act as a therapeutic target of lung cancer. Targeting CYLD, in combination with TRAIL, may be a new strategy to treat lung cancer with high NF - B activity. Cyld encodes a 956-amino acid deubiquitinating enzyme, which is a negative regulator of nuclear factor kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Mutations that truncate and inactivate the carboxyl-terminal deubiquitinating domain of CYLD underlie the development of skin appendage tumors in humans, whereas down-regulation of Cyld expression has been associated with the development of various types of human malignancies including lung cancer. To establish an animal model of human CYLD inactivation and characterize the biological role of CYLD in vivo, we generated mice carrying a homozygous deletion of Cyld exon 9 mice ) using a conditional approach. Our study identifies an important role of CYLD in lung maturation, which may underlie the development of many cases of lung cancer. "}

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her\/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer.\nRetroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production. Several monogenic inherited diseases, mostly immunodeficiencies, can now be successfully treated."}

Pull-down experiments and surface plasmon resonance data indicate a direct interaction between NS3 and NS5B that is primarily mediated through the protease domain of NS3. This interaction reduces the basal ATPase activity of NS3. However, NS5B stimulates product formation in RNA unwinding experiments under conditions of excess nucleic acid substrate. When the concentrations of NS3 and NS5B are in excess of nucleic acid substrate, NS5B reduces the rate of NS3-catalyzed unwinding.

Physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells. One mechanism may be that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome.

{"sent":"Are genes symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging DNA strand in bacteria?","qc":["C0004611"],"exact_answer":"no","ideal_answer":"In most bacteria, genes are preferentially encoded on the leading strand than on the lagging strand. This avoids the potentially detrimental head-on collisions that occur between the replication and transcription machineries when genes are encoded on the lagging strand. Head-on collisions are more deleterious than codirectional collisions, and may lead to replication fork arrest and genomic instability. Genes of some functional categories such as ribosome have higher preferences to be on the leading strands, while genes of other functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on the lagging strands. Strand-biased gene distribution correlates with replication-associated purine asymmetry and the presence or absence of polC. Especially essential and highly transcribed genes and genes whose expression is important for fitness are more preferentially situated at the leading strand in bacteria."}

The open chromatin of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) condenses into repressive heterochromatin as cells exit the pluripotent state. The relation between alterations in chromatin structure and changes in gene expression during cell differentiation has served as a paradigm to understand the link between genome organization and function. Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales. The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression."}

Thalidomide is considered the drug of choice for the treatment of ENL, but for other conditions, it is recommended only when resistance to the currently available form of therapy is encountered. THE USE OF A DRUG WITH A TEMPORARY MARKETING AUTHORISATION: Thalidomide is currently available in France for nominative or cohort use with a temporary marketing authorisation (TMA). Examples of the basis for such regulation are drawn from historical situations (thalidomide, benoxaprofen) as well as currently marketed drugs (arylpropionic acids, disopyramide, indacrinone). In 1998 the US Food and Drug Administration approved thalidomide exclusively for the treatment of ENL, and strict conditions were stipulated for its use in order to prevent teratogenic adverse effects. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Thalomid (thalidomide) capsules for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL. The revival of thalidomide began shortly after the drug was withdrawn from the market because of its teratogenic properties."}

Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes. The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me). We review the signaling pathways and functions associated with a single residue, H4K20, as a model chromatin and clinically important mark that regulates biological processes ranging from the DNA damage response and DNA replication to gene expression and silencing. <CopyrightInformation>\u00a9 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.<\/C In particular, the methylation states of H3K4, H3K36 and H4K20 have been associated with establishing active, repressed or poised origins depending on the timing and extent of methylation. 5BrC and 5ClC may cause aberrant methylation of cytosine during DNA replication and mimic the endogenous methylation signal associated with gene silencing."}

{"sent":"Is there any treatment for the Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy?","qc":["C0087111","C0238288","C1533734"],"exact_answer":"no","ideal_answer":"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a slowly progressive genetic disorder that affects the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms. Unfortunately, there are currently no approved therapies for FSHD, and treatment is limited to supportive measures such as physical therapy and pain management. While several potential treatments are being investigated in clinical trials, none have yet been proven effective in slowing or reversing the progression of the disease. Some promising approaches include gene therapy, which aims to correct the genetic defect responsible for FSHD, and drugs that target specific pathways involved in muscle degeneration. However, further research is needed to determine their safety and efficacy before they can be widely used in clinical practice. In summary, while there is currently no cure for FSHD, ongoing research offers hope for future treatments that may improve outcomes for patients with this debilitating condition."}
{"sent":"Do all proteins start with methionine?","qc":["C0034504","C0025646","C0033684"],"exact_answer":"no","ideal_answer":"All proteins do not necessarily start with methionine, but it is common for eukaryotic and archaeal proteins to begin with this amino acid. During the initiation of translation, the first codon in the mRNA sequence is typically an AUG codon, which codes for methionine. This process is facilitated by the initiator tRNA (tRNAi^Met) that carries methionine and recognizes the start codon. However, there are exceptions to this rule. In some cases, alternative start codons such as CUG, GUG, or UUG can be used to initiate translation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These alternative start codons usually code for amino acids like leucine or valine instead of methionine. Additionally, post-translational modifications can occur after protein synthesis, leading to the removal of the initial methionine or its modification into another amino acid like acetylated methionine or formylmethionine (fMet), which is commonly found in bacterial proteins. Therefore, while many proteins do initially start with methionine due to the canonical AUG start codon, there are exceptions where alternative initiation events or post-translational modifications result in proteins that do not begin with this amino acid."}
